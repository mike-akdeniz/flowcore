# Tests run against a real Postgres. The schema is applied by goose (which is not
# a Go dependency — it is invoked here as an installed CLI), then `go test` runs
# against it. `make test` does both, so daily use is one command.

# Override to point at another database, e.g.
#   make test FLOWCORE_TEST_DSN=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=disable
FLOWCORE_TEST_DSN ?= postgres://flowcore:flowcore@localhost:5432/flowcore_test?sslmode=disable

# Run the suite: apply migrations, then test against the migrated schema.
#
# Deliberately does not depend on `up`. FLOWCORE_TEST_DSN may point at a database
# that is not the local container, and starting a container in that case would be
# both useless and confusing. Run `make up` yourself once per boot.

# Throw away the test schema and goose's record of it, so the next `make test`
# migrates from nothing.
#
# Both halves are necessary. goose keeps its history in a table outside the schema
# it manages, so dropping `flowcore` alone leaves flowcore_goose_db_version saying
# every migration is applied — the next run then migrates nothing, reports
# success, and fails on the first query against a table that no longer exists.
#
# This is the blunt instrument. `migrate-test-down` is the surgical one: it rolls
# back a single migration and keeps goose's history straight by itself.
