# Overview

The evolving system design for FlowCore, and the scope of each iteration.
This is the authoritative design document: boundary, flows, state, responsibilities, invariants, and trade-offs.
It changes as decisions land — decisions are recorded here first, then implemented.

The rationale behind individual decisions — the options weighed and rejected — lives in `docs/decisions.md`.
This document records what the system is; the decision log records why.

# Boundary

_What are we designing? What we are not designing?_

A workflow library, designed to support human-in-the-loop AI review steps (iteration 2).

This is a code library that can called by the clients via class methods.
It's not a web API, Microservice, application...
You can just add the library to your codebase, migrate the db, and use - extend it.
It would be straightforward for devs to use this library as a foundation for an API or Microservice if the need arises.

Library is "workflow subject" agnostic.
Workflow subject could be a logo design or expense form. or...
Library doesn't hold these subjects, it doesn't try to be a document store.

Library owns a Postgres schema and ships migrations for it.
Devs run those migrations into their own Postgres instance; the tables are the library's source of truth for configuration and workflow state.
The schema lives in a dedicated `flowcore` Postgres schema, and every query is schema-qualified in Go — the library never relies on the client's `search_path`.

Library is also identity-agnostic.
It records who a step is assigned to and who completed it, but never interprets those identifiers and never enforces permissions.
Group membership, roles and authorization policy live in the client system.

In short, the boundary is a code library and lightweight db offering AI enhanced workflow functionality.

# Actors

Library
Dev: Developer using the library
Caller: Client code that calls the library.
Client System: The system that interacts with the Library via Caller.

# Flows

_What are the main user/system journeys?_

This is an overview, a starting point to discover important structure and move forward.
We are not aiming for perfection or extensive discovery.

_A note on terminology:_ the configuration-side entities are **definitions** — a workflow definition is a template.
A **workflow** is a running instance started from a definition.
Definitions are edited through the `Catalog` component; instances are run by the `Engine`.

_Configure Workflow_
Dev creates a new workflow definition ("Expense Approval") and defines:

- workflow statuses > > "not started", "in progress", "approved", "rejected"...
- the workflow steps > manager review
- workflow status on each step
- the entry step the workflow begins on
- possible actions for each step, and for each action either the next step it leads to or the terminal status it ends the workflow in.

How does the dev perform the configuration?

> Library has methods for configuration.
> Dev is responsible for making the calls via any suitable method. (Dev can create a console app, management page - portal...)

_Start Basic Workflow_
Caller submits "subject id, subject version token, workflow definition id," to the library.
Library starts a new workflow for that subject at the definition's declared entry step, returns current step: {stepId, actions[{id:1, name: "approve"}, {id:2, name:"reject"}]}

Caller can change the definition any time; running instances are not affected by that change.

> Start "Expense Approval" for document 123

_Get Current Step_
Caller asks for the current step for a {subject, workflow definition}, library returns

{ "workflow_status": "In Progress"
"subject": {
id: ...,
versionToken: ...
}
"current_step":
{
name: "manager review",
actions: [
{id:1, name: "approve"},
{id:2, name:"reject"}
]
}

> What step is currently on "Expense Approval for document 123"? => Manager review

The definition id is part of the request, not just the subject.
Two runs of _different_ definitions may be active on one subject at the same time, so the subject alone does not identify a run.

_Complete Step_
Caller sends {visitId, actionId, completedBy, subjectVersionToken}.
Library validates, stamps completedBy, executes the workflow, returns workflow_status and current_step.

The visit id, not a step id, is what identifies the work being completed.
There is only ever one open visit per run, so nothing needs identifying — the id is there to catch a caller acting on a stale view.
A step id cannot do that job once loops exist: a run that advanced and looped back sits on the same step again, so a stale step id still matches and the decision lands on a visit the caller never saw.
Subject reference and definition id are not sent; the visit identifies the run.

_Get Assigned Steps (worklist)_
Caller sends a set of opaque assignee references — typically the current user plus their group memberships, resolved client-side — and the library returns open steps whose assigneeId is in that set.
This is how assignment becomes useful without the library knowing what a group is.

# State

_What must be remembered for each flow by the library?_

The definition-side entities (`WorkflowDefinition`, `WorkflowStatusDefinition`, `StepDefinition`, `ActionDefinition`) are templates.
The instance-side entities (`Workflow`, `Step`, `Action`) are snapshots taken from a definition at start time, plus `StepVisit`, which is not a snapshot of anything — it is the record of work performed.

The snapshot is taken **eagerly and whole** at start: every status, step, and action of the definition is copied.
The run never reads the definition again, which is what makes immunity to later definition edits structural rather than a matter of timing.

`StepVisit` is separate from `Step` deliberately, and the two have different rhythms.
A `Step` row is written once at start, one per definition step, and carries no execution state at all.
A `StepVisit` row is written each time the run _enters_ a step, so a step not yet reached has no visit row — absence of a row, never a null timestamp, is how "not yet visited" is represented.
A step entered twice by a loop therefore has two visit rows, and both are preserved.

Every instance row also records the id of the definition row it was copied from.
Those ids are recorded, never enforced by a foreign key: they are the rename-stable handle for cross-run queries, and they keep working after the definition row they name has been edited or deleted.

_Workflow Definition_

- id
- name
- initial step definition id // the entry step the workflow begins on; set by the aggregate create, references a step in this same definition
- status definitions
- step definitions

_Workflow Status Definition_

- id
- workflow definition id
- name

_Step Definition_

- id
- workflow definition id
- actions
- workflow status definition id
- assignee_id // opaque reference to the person or group expected to act on this step. Required — a step with no decided owner carries a value saying so, chosen by the client. A default, copied to the Step at workflow start.
- instructions // optional text describing the work, for a person or an agent. The library records and snapshots it but never executes or interprets it.
- required_input_type_ids // `text[]` of opaque client-defined IDs for the kinds of material a decision on this step requires. Empty is allowed. The library records and snapshots them but does not resolve them or enforce presence.

_Action Definition_

- id
- workflow definition id // denormalized, carried so the same-definition composite FKs have a column to match on
- step definition id // the step this action belongs to
- name
- next step definition id // nullable; the step this action routes to. Exactly one of this / terminal status is set.
- terminal workflow status definition id // nullable; the status the workflow ends in when this action completes. Exactly one of this / next step is set.

_Workflow_

- id
- workflow definition id // provenance, recorded not enforced. Also the key, with the subject, of the one-active-run invariant.
- name // frozen from the definition at start
- subjectId
- subjectVersionToken // captured at start. Nullable: a client that does not version its subjects is not forced to fabricate a token.
- workflow status definition id + workflow status name // stamped at every transition, see the Workflow invariant
- started_at
- completed_at // null while the run is open. The structural open/complete marker — never inferred from a status name.
- steps
- current step // derived, not stored: the one step visit with no completed_at. There is no current-step pointer column.

_Step_ (snapshot)

- id
- workflow id
- step definition id // provenance
- name // frozen
- workflow status definition id + workflow status name // frozen; the status the run shows while sitting on this step
- assignee_id // the frozen _default_, copied from StepDefinition at start, immutable thereafter. Required, since its source is.
- instructions // frozen from the definition at start
- required_input_type_ids // frozen from the definition at start, including on steps the run never visits
- actions

_Action_ (snapshot)

- id
- workflow id // denormalized, carried so the same-workflow composite FKs have a column to match on
- step id
- action definition id // provenance
- name
- next step id // nullable; the step this action routes to
- terminal workflow status definition id + terminal workflow status name // nullable. Exactly one of next step / terminal status is set.

_Step Visit_

- id
- workflow id
- step id
- assignee_id // the live assignee for _this visit_, seeded from the step's frozen default on entry, mutable afterwards (reassignment). Required: reassignment takes a value, so no write can clear it.
- entered_at
- completed_at, completed_by, selectedAction // all three set together or none of them; a half-stamped visit is unrepresentable
- subjectVersionToken // stamped at completion, from the value the caller supplies

The snapshot step, not the definition step, answers what instruction and input types applied to a run.
`CurrentStep` exposes both, and historical visit reads expose the frozen required input type IDs needed to explain a completed decision.
An action's selected immediate destination can be read from the instance snapshot before completion, including that destination's assignee and required input type IDs.
The library does not decide which references name agents or which inputs exist: the client makes those decisions.

There is no instance-side workflow status _entity_.
A status has no attribute but a name, and per-run status ids would be useless to any caller — two runs started a minute apart would hold different ids for the same logical status, so no cross-run query could key on them.
The only stable handle is the definition's status id, which is recorded alongside the frozen name wherever a status is referenced.

# Responsibilities

_What decisions must be made, and who owns them?
Does any component emerge naturally?_

- Who starts the workflow run? => Engine
- Who is the source of truth for providing aggregated info about a workflow run? => Engine
- Who processes a step run request? => Engine
- Who is the source of truth for current step run? => Engine

_Catalog_

- Provides ergonomic workflow definition generation for clients via an aggregate.
- Collects the workflow definition needed for a workflow start.
- Realized concretely by the exported `Catalog` type (constructed with `NewCatalog(pool)`), holding the pool and owning definition-side transactions.
- Create is the only aggregate write — the whole definition tree in one transaction.
  Everything else is granular per-entity CRUD.
- Create accepts a whole definition tree and defaults the entry step to the first step when the caller leaves it unset; an explicitly-set entry step must reference a step in the tree, checked before the transaction.
- Update semantics are full-replace of an entity's own scalar columns, never a cascade into children: an Update owns exactly its own row, and children are managed through their own Add/Update/Delete methods.
  Parent-membership and identity columns are immutable; re-parenting is Delete + Add.
  Each mutating operation takes a dedicated params struct carrying only the columns it may set, so the contract is enforced by the input type's shape rather than by documentation; a read type's `ToUpdate()` pre-fills those params from current state.

_Engine_

- Starts a workflow.
- Provides aggregated information for a run.
- Validates and processes a step complete request.
- Provides current step for a given workflow.
- Exposes open visits without requiring an assignee list, so a client can recover work using the instance-side truth even after a definition changes.
- Exposes an action's immediate destination from the snapshot for client-side preflight checks; it does not validate the client's material or permissions.

_WorkflowStatusDefinition, WorkflowDefinition, StepDefinition, ActionDefinition_

- Allows granular CRUD operations for definition objects.

_Workflow_

- Provides the details for a specific workflow instance.
- Provides current step.

_Step_

- Provides possible actions for the current step.
- Provides the step's frozen default assignee.

_Step Visit_

- Provides which version of the subject was worked on via "subjectVersionToken",
- Provides the action that was selected.
- Provides who the visit is assigned to (assigneeId) and who completed it (completedBy).
- Does not decide whether the completing actor was permitted to act.
- Is append-only in effect: a closed visit is never rewritten, so reassigning a step cannot retroactively change who a past decision was assigned to.

# Synchronization

_Handling concurrent events, duplicates, retries, and ordering._

The dangerous concurrent operations:

- Within the same library process multiple clients are:
  - configuring the same definition.
  - starting same workflow definition for the same subject.
  - completing any step on the same workflow.

- Duplicate calls with the same params.

- Different library processes: are:
  - configuring the same definition.
  - starting same workflow definition for the same subject.
  - completing any step on the same workflow.

Solutions to consider:

- Single-threaded event loop
- Lock/mutex
- Database transaction
- Unique constraint
- Idempotency key
- Message queue
- Version number / optimistic concurrency
- Retry with deduplication

# Invariants

_The rules that must never be violated._

_Definitions_

- Always provides most recent and consistent version of the definition.
  Never provides a definition that is still under construction, never a previous stale definition.
- Same-definition integrity: a step's status, and an action's next step, always reference rows belonging to the same definition.
  Enforced in schema by composite foreign keys, not by application checks.
- The reference foreign keys are `DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED`, so a whole-definition delete — whose cascade transiently leaves an action pointing at an already-deleted status — is checked at commit, when the state is consistent again.
  Single-statement operations still surface violations immediately, so referenced-delete and cross-definition blocks are unaffected.

_Engine_

- Starts only one active workflow for a {subject, workflowDefinition}.
  Enforced in schema by a partial unique index over open workflows, not by an application check.
- Completes a step if it's the current workflow step and the requested action exists in the step.
  The second clause is enforced in schema: the selected action is referenced by a composite foreign key on (step, action), so an action belonging to a different step is rejected by the database.
- Completes a step only a single time.
  Enforced in schema by the partial unique index over open step visits: two concurrent completions of one run cannot both insert the next visit, and the loser is rejected.

_Workflow_

- The Engine **stamps** the workflow's status at every transition: from the entered step's snapshot status on a routing transition, from the terminating action's terminal status on a terminating one.
  Status is therefore a function of position in the graph and is never independently assignable.
  This is a stamping rule, not a derivation rule — the stored value is authoritative, and its provenance is the transition that wrote it.
- At most one open step visit per workflow: exactly one while the run is in progress, zero once it is complete.
- Open versus complete is answered by `completed_at`, never inferred from a status name.
  The library does not interpret status names, so it cannot use one to decide whether a run is finished.
- Instructions and required input type IDs on a running step come from the step snapshot, even when the definition is edited or deleted.

#Failure handling

_Detect, isolate, retry, compensate, or degrade._

Complicated failure handling like queues, retries are mostly the responsibility of the client system.

Major failure modes for the library itself: - Runtime exceptions. > Is the library responsible for logging or does it propagate the exception to the caller?

    - DB connectivity loss.
    > Library can't function without a DB, halt the operation.
    We should not allow half-saved config or workflow states in DB.
    Are DB transactions enough to prevent that?

    - Stuck - killed process.
    > Managing process is the responsibility of the client system.
    Could the solution to the "DB connectivity loss" be enough for this failure mode as well?

    - Infinite workflow step loops.
    > A validation on StepDefinition could be implemented later to prevent loops. (tortoise and hare algo?)

# Scale

_Identify bottlenecks and evolve the design._

What grows?
Requests per second?
Number of users?
Number of objects?
Read traffic?
Write traffic?
Fanout?
Storage?

Most of the scale problems reside on the client system.
Client system can resolve those questions by scaling the library instances, storage options, using caching etc...

For library, current performance - scaling enablers are: - proper database indexes - constructing efficient sql queries

# Tradeoffs

_What this design optimizes and what it sacrifices._

_Scope: Library - Full Solution_
This design encapsulates workflow functionality in a library with client system handling UI, logging, scaling as needed.
Adaptability, simplicity is traded for a more complete, out of the box "workflow system".
This could be the perfect addition for any existing system that needs the workflow functionalities.

_Workflow mutation: Allow mutation - No mutation, Version Every Config Changes_
Definition objects (WorkflowDefinition, StepDefinition...) are used as templates to start and run the actual workflow instances.
This prevents weird mutations of the inflight workflow instances when a definition is mutated.

Workflow starts for a definition with "Director Approval" step.
From the definition "Director Approval" is removed.
Running workflow still awaits the "Director Approval."

The rule is: definition changes take effect on net new workflows.
Allowing definition changes to apply to running workflows would make them subject to a "partially executed on version A, then version B" state.

We could have versioned all definition changes with version numbers so that all versions are accessible but that would create much complexity with little benefit.

With current design system offers answer to the most important questions: - What is the current definition for new start? => Db definition rows are the source of truth - What are the possible steps and actions for this workflow in flight? => Db workflow, step rows are the source of truth - Why this finished workflow reached this state in the end? => Db workflow, step rows are the source of truth

This is achieved by the fact that the workflow and steps are effectively a snapshot of the definition's state when the workflow has started.

_Subject mutation: No library support for immutability - Library Enforced Strict Immutability_
With the library being subject agnostic, it's foreseeable to run into cases where the approved subject changes silently:
"When I approved this expense form, the total was 100$ and not 10000$, who changed this?"

First instinct to resolve this is to store a copy of the subject in the library for each step but that would turn the library into a document store.

We decided to follow the following mechanism instead: the library holds an opaque subject reference plus an opaque version token (a hash, a revision id — the engine doesn't care, the consumer supplies it), captured at instance start and stamped onto every recorded decision.
Now "which revision did the strategist approve" is answerable from audit history forever, and the library never learned what a logo is.
Whether a changed token invalidates prior approvals or forces re-approval — that's policy, it varies by domain, and it's precisely the kind of thing that lives above the ceiling, in consumer code or a later config flag.

This trade-off removes enforcement from the library but still gives the client the power to enforce immutability in any shape it wants.

_Workflow status: positional - set by transition_
Status is a function of where the run is, not something an action sets independently.
A step names its status once, and every run sitting on that step shows it.

The cost is a real expressiveness limit, and it is accepted deliberately: **two actions routing to the same step cannot produce different workflow statuses.**
If "approve" and "request more info" both route back to a Rework step, they cannot show "In Rework" and "Awaiting Information" respectively — the only remedy is to duplicate the step, which pollutes the graph and splits one queue into two.

The alternative was to carry status on transitions: every action names the status it results in, and the definition carries an initial status.
That removes the limit and collapses the invariant to "whatever the last transition set," with no lifecycle branch.
It was rejected because it loses the integrity property — two actions routing to one step could then set contradictory statuses, so a run's status would no longer agree with where it actually is — and because it makes authoring repeat a status on every action converging on a step.
If the limit is ever hit in practice, this is the shape to reach for.

_Subject version token: guaranteed - opt-in_
The token is nullable, so the immutability-audit property above is available to every client but guaranteed by the library for none.
Requiring it would mean enforcing a policy the library disclaims — that subjects must be versioned — and a client with immutable subjects would be made to fabricate a value forever.
A client that wants the guarantee enforces presence above the library.

_Assignment: engine-enforced permissions - engine-recorded identity_
A workflow engine without assignment is not useful: someone has to be able to find what is waiting for them.
The question is whether the library should also enforce that only the assignee may complete a step.

Strict enforcement would mean checking completedBy against assigneeId.
That breaks as soon as an assignee is a group, because deciding whether a person belongs to a group requires the client's identity model, which the library deliberately does not have.
Opaque identifiers can be compared for equality, but equality is not membership.

So the library records identity and does not enforce it, mirroring the subject-token decision: references are captured and stamped, interpretation stays with the client.
Assignment still earns its place in the library through the worklist query — the client resolves the user's memberships and passes the resulting set, and the library filters on it.

Definition assigneeId is a default; instance assigneeId is the truth, and is mutable so steps can be reassigned.

An assignee is required at all three levels, and there is no unassigned state.
The column is an opaque string the library never interprets, so a step whose owner is undecided says so with a value the client chooses — `unassigned`, `pool:support`, `system:auto` — and every such value is findable.
NULL is not: the worklist matches with `assignee_id = any($1)`, which NULL never satisfies, so an unassigned visit would be open, completable, and in nobody's queue.
Reassignment can move work between assignees but cannot remove one.

If engine-side enforcement is wanted later, the shape is a client-supplied check invoked before completion (canComplete(step, actorId)), not an equality test — enforcement at the library's gate, judgment in client code.
This changes no tables and can be added when a real need appears.

# Stack

Go, Postgres, pgx v5 (native API), hand-written SQL in a repository layer, plain SQL migrations, tests against real Postgres.

The library is a single package `flowcore` at the module root.
Privacy comes from identifier case, not directory layout: the store — hand-written SQL and pgx calls — is unexported in its own files; the exported surface (`Catalog`, the definition types, the params structs, the error taxonomy) sits alongside it.
`internal/` is not used; it buys nothing for a single-package module and would force a read/write type split with a mapping tax.

IDs are UUIDv7, application-generated in Go before insert (`github.com/google/uuid`), `uuid` columns with no database default.
App-generated ids let the aggregate create assign every id up front, so an action can reference a step declared later in the same transaction with no `RETURNING` round-trips, and let a client store a stable id that is identical across dev, staging, and prod.

The store functions take a `querier` — a small unexported interface (`Exec`/`Query`/`QueryRow`) satisfied by both `*pgxpool.Pool` and `pgx.Tx` — so the same helper composes into autocommit or into a transaction.
Transaction control lives only in the service types, never in the store: `Catalog.Create` and `Catalog.Get`, and `Engine.Start`, `Engine.CompleteStep`, and `Engine.GetState`.
Helpers never begin a transaction — `Begin` is deliberately absent from the `querier` interface, so a helper is incapable of it rather than merely discouraged.

A `querier` parameter states that a helper _composes_ into either; it states nothing about atomicity, and cannot, because a single statement is atomic on its own.
Helpers that issue several statements are a different case: run on the pool, each statement commits independently, so a failure part-way leaves state no caller intended, and multi-query reads tear.
Those take `txQuerier` instead — `querier` plus `Conn`, which `pgx.Tx` has and `*pgxpool.Pool` does not — so passing a pool fails to compile rather than silently corrupting a run.
`Begin` is absent from that interface too: it lets a helper _require_ a transaction, never start one.
The reading rule follows from this: a `querier` parameter means "ask my caller", a `txQuerier` parameter means "a transaction is already open", and only the five service methods above can be the answer.

The isolation level is chosen per site rather than set once, and the two Engine write paths deliberately differ.
`Start` is `RepeatableRead`, because it reads a definition over four queries and must not snapshot a definition that never existed as a whole; it only inserts rows whose ids it generated, so it cannot hit a serialization failure.
`Complete` is `ReadCommitted`, because its conditional update must block and re-check rather than abort: that is what turns a concurrent completion into a typed `VisitNotOpenError` instead of a `40001` the library has no answer for.
`Catalog.Get` and `Engine.GetState` are `RepeatableRead` plus `ReadOnly`, which cannot fail to serialize.
The other Catalog methods are single statements and take no transaction at all.
The idiom at every transaction site is `Begin` then an immediate `defer func() { _ = tx.Rollback(ctx) }()`, `Commit` at the end — the post-commit rollback returns `pgx.ErrTxClosed` and is ignored, which is what guarantees no leaked connection on any error path.

Errors surface as a small typed taxonomy over the DB's rejections, mapped centrally: constraint violations are keyed on SQLSTATE plus the explicitly-named constraint, and because a referencing insert and a referenced delete are byte-identical at the FK level, the mapping is split by operation intent into a write path and a delete path.
Every typed error wraps a sentinel so both `errors.Is` and `errors.As` work.
This requires every constraint the mapper switches on — unique indexes, composite FKs, CHECKs — to be explicitly named in the migrations.
Alongside these DB-mapped errors, Create performs pre-flight input checks that produce plain field-less sentinels (`ErrNoSteps`, `ErrInitialStepNotInTree`) before any transaction; these are `errors.Is`-matchable but have no typed form, since they map no DB rejection and carry no per-occurrence detail.
A third case, `UnmappedConstraintError`, is the mapper's fallback for a constraint name it does not recognize — it fails loudly rather than guessing a domain error, and carries the original `pgconn` error for diagnosis; it has no live trigger through the current schema and exists as a safeguard against a future migration adding a constraint the mapper isn't taught about.

Migrations: goose (github.com/pressly/goose/v3).
Chosen because FlowCore ships migrations for clients to run into their own Postgres, and goose serves both consumption paths from the same files — a CLI for local development, and an embedded programmatic entrypoint (embed.FS) so a client can apply migrations from application code without installing a tool.
Its annotations are SQL comments, so the files remain runnable under plain psql by a client DBA.
It also has no "dirty schema" state to clear by hand after a failed migration, which is the wrong burden to hand an operator of someone else's library.

Migrations run over database/sql via the github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/stdlib adapter, since goose is written against database/sql.
This is scoped to the migration path only: the repository layer uses pgxpool and the native pgx API.
Same driver, two façades, at different moments.
The embedded path is `Migrate(ctx, pool)`, which applies the migrations from application code; the CLI path is the Makefile.
Both must name the same version table, so the name is a constant in Go and a variable in the Makefile rather than a literal in either.

goose's version table is `public.flowcore_goose_db_version` so the library's migration history can never collide with a client that also uses goose for their own migrations.
Both halves of that name are load-bearing.
The prefix pins it against `search_path`: Postgres resolves `"$user"` to the connecting role, so on a database whose role is also named `flowcore`, `current_schema()` is `public` before migration 00001 runs and `flowcore` after it — because that migration creates the schema.
An unqualified version table is therefore written to one schema and looked for in another between runs, and a version table that landed inside `flowcore` would be destroyed by 00001's own down-migration.
It cannot simply live inside `flowcore` instead: goose creates the version table before running any migration, when the schema does not yet exist.

Every stored text column carries a length cap.
Opaque client-supplied identifiers (subject reference, subject version token, assignee, completedBy) cap at 500; human-facing names cap at 200.
The caps are not hygiene: they are the reversible direction (raising one is an `ALTER`, lowering one after clients hold longer data is impossible), and "opaque" means the library will not _interpret_ a value, not that it will absorb unbounded storage and read cost for it.

Concurrency on the completion path is settled, and by a constraint rather than a locking mechanism.
At most one open step visit per workflow is a partial unique index, so two concurrent completions of one run cannot both insert the next visit — the loser is rejected with a unique violation, which maps through the existing error machinery.
No version column, no `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, no serializable isolation.

Open: test Postgres provisioning (testcontainers | docker-compose).

# Iteration 1 Scope

Flows:
_Configure Workflow_
_Start Basic Workflow_
_Get Current Step_
_Complete Step_

Out of scope: AI review steps, Synchronization, Failure Handling, Scale

** Increment 2 candidate: automated advisory step type (findings + human override + audit)
a step type exists whose executor is external, async, fallible, and advisory rather than deciding.
flow idea: "AI director pre-check" -> finds 7 issues and shows warnings -> salesperson reviews the issues and makes changes or overrides the warnings...

# Iteration 2 Scope

Flows:
_Get Assigned Steps (worklist)_ — assignee-keyed only
_Reassign Step_
_Complete Step_ — gains an optional remark

AI review steps are in scope and need no new mechanism.
An AI review step is an ordinary step whose `assignee_id` is an opaque agent reference, completed by whatever acts on its behalf.
This supersedes the increment 2 candidate noted above: "advisory rather than deciding" is not a step type but graph topology, chosen per definition — an advisory step's actions converge on a human step, a deciding step's diverge.
Human override is the human completing the agent's visit, which the completer-need-not-be-assignee rule already permits, and a superseded agent's late completion is refused by the existing stale-visit check.

The two capabilities that make an agent usable as an actor are the worklist, so work addressed to it can be found, and the remark, so the reason for a decision is stamped in the same transaction as the decision.
Reassignment joins them because the worklist is what gives it a caller: a queue you can read and not manage is half a feature.

Out of scope: parallel steps and joins, N-of-M voting, the library calling a model or constructing model-specific prompts, agent retry and failure policy, `step_visit.step_definition_id` and the two indexes keyed on it, Scale.

# CaseWork-driven extension after iteration 2

The reference client exposed two pieces of workflow configuration that need the same snapshot guarantee as names, assignees, and actions: step instructions and required input type IDs.
The instruction is neutral text for any actor, not a model prompt owned or executed by the library.
The references are opaque identifiers supplied by a client; CaseWork supplies its document type IDs, while FlowCore neither knows what a document is nor checks whether one exists.
FlowCore does not acquire a record-type catalog or a workflow subject-type column.
Both values are copied eagerly into every instance step at `Start` and read from the instance for running and historical work.
The client's case type, document type catalog, and document records remain outside FlowCore.

Recovery discovery also follows instances rather than definitions.
A generic open-step read gives clients the live assignees from open visits; CaseWork decides which of those references it dispatches as agents and which sessions it owns.
The existing assignee-keyed worklist keeps its meaning, including returning nothing for an empty reference set.

For a client that must validate the first step before a run exists, `Start` must offer a way to validate the exact definition read in its transaction before writing the snapshot.
The caller supplies the policy and material; FlowCore only runs the check against its consistent definition read and aborts the start when it fails.
The same consistency need does not apply to later transitions: their targets and required input types are already frozen, and the client can inspect the selected immediate destination before calling `CompleteStep`.

The resolutions behind these — why the library never calls a model, why sequential-only, and the shape of the remark — land as decisions 39 onward and are written into the sections above.
