# Overview

The design for FlowCore's reference client: CaseWork, an insurer's internal case console, built on the library.

This is the authoritative design document for CaseWork — boundary, actors, flows, state, screens, responsibilities, and invariants.
It changes as decisions land.

The rationale behind individual decisions, and the alternatives they beat, lives in `client/docs/decisions.md`.
This document records what CaseWork is; the decision log records why.

The library has its own pair of documents at `docs/system-design.md` and `docs/decisions.md`.
Nothing here overrides them, and no decision recorded here changes the library.

## Three names, three things

The vocabulary is fixed, because two of these words are easy to blur.

**Library** is FlowCore. Concrete.

**Client** is the *role*: whatever consumes the library. It is the word the library's own documents
use, and it is what sentences about the boundary are about — "the client half of the boundary", "the
engine knows where the work is, the client knows what the work is about", "authorization is the
client's job and nothing below enforces it". Any application could fill that role.

**CaseWork** is this application: an insurer's case console for claims and new policy applications.
It is the thing currently filling the client role, and it is what sentences about tables, screens,
tenancy and seeding are about. Its Postgres schema is `casework`.

So the module is `client/` because that names the role and explains why the directory exists in a
library's repository, and the application inside it is CaseWork. A sentence needs the role word or
the product word, never both, and swapping them is always wrong: "the CaseWork half of the boundary"
and "the client's own submissions" are each a category error.

# Boundary

_What are we building? What are we not building?_

An **internal case console for an insurer**: the screens its own staff use to process work that has arrived.
It handles two kinds of submission — **claims** and **new policy applications** — each moving through a configurable workflow, with some steps decided by people and some by an AI agent.

It is a real application, not a harness.
The previous version existed to make the library's boundary legible, and carried explanatory prose and a call log on every screen; that goal is gone, along with those.
A working application argues for the library by working.

**Three goals, in the owner's order.**

1. A UI portfolio piece: a backend developer working competently with modern front-end tools.
2. A workflow application that shows what is possible with FlowCore, especially its AI steps.
3. An extension of 2: configuring a workflow is part of the product, not a settings page.
   Configure a workflow easily, and understand one easily.

**Out of scope.**

Claimant-facing submission.
Those applications are commodity — a form with uploads — and a processing console is the essential half, working without one.
An _internal_ submission form is in scope, because a handler takes details over the phone or from an email.

Real authentication, user management, and permissions.
The cast is seeded and sign-in is a choice from a list.

File upload and binary storage.
Documents are records carrying text.

Workflow selection, agent dispatch, tenancy and identity are all the client's, which is how FlowCore is designed.
The agent-step configuration work extends FlowCore's neutral step data and snapshot read surface without making FlowCore responsible for documents, models, or case permissions.

# Actors

_Who uses this, and what do they do?_

One shared cast for the whole application.
Both workflows are worked by the same organisation, so there is one Dana Whitfield and not one per workflow.

- **Intake** — takes submissions, chases missing documents.
- **Adjusters** — assess and settle claims.
- **SIU** — investigate claims the fraud check flags.
- **Underwriters** and **senior underwriters** — decide new policy applications.

**Agents** are actors too, and that is the whole point of how FlowCore treats them.
An agent is a step whose assignee happens to be `agent:triage` rather than `group:adjusters`.
The library cannot tell the difference and never needs to.

**The visitor** is whoever opened the application.
They sign in as one of the cast, and may switch.

# Flows

_The main journeys._

_Take a submission, and start its workflow_

A handler enters a claim or an application from a phone call or an email.
It exists as a draft until they submit it for assessment.

Submitting is what starts a FlowCore run.
The client looks up which workflow is active for that submission type, and calls `Start` with its definition id.
Triage is therefore two levels, and only the second is a human's:

- The client picks the **workflow**, from the submission's type.
- An AI step inside the workflow picks the **path** — fast-track or full assessment — and the run branches.

A seeded submission arrives as a draft with no run, so a visitor's first action is submitting it and watching the first AI step fire.
Before starting on an agent step, CaseWork requires every document type named by that entry step to be present on the case.
The check must use the same definition that FlowCore snapshots; a failed check leaves the submission in draft with no run.

_Work my queue_

Sign in, see what is waiting, open it, decide, optionally leave a remark.

The queue is FlowCore's worklist, filtered to this visitor's own data.
The client expands the signed-in person into the references they answer to — themselves plus their groups — because deciding group membership needs an identity model the library deliberately does not have.

_Follow a case_

Where it stands, what has happened, who did what and why.
This includes what the agents found: an agent's finding is the remark on its visit, recorded in the same transaction as its decision.

_Configure a workflow_

Build a workflow, understand one, and choose which is active for a submission type.

Understanding and editing are separate screens, because they want opposite things.
Understanding wants one large, uncluttered diagram; editing wants forms and destructive buttons.

Activating a new workflow affects only submissions made afterwards.
Cases already running keep the workflow they started under, which is FlowCore's snapshot guarantee and needs nothing from the client but a changeable pointer.

_Add documents and decide_

Each submission type has an explicit set of document types that may be filed for it.
The Add document selector shows that set throughout a case, whether the case is draft or on any workflow step; it does not narrow to the current step.
Each step separately declares the document types required for a decision on that step, and the case screen shows them with their present or missing state beside the current step and assignee.
CaseWork refuses a human decision while a required type is missing.
An agent step's instruction must be nonempty, and its required documents are the documents the agent receives for assessment.
Before a selected action hands control to an agent step, CaseWork checks that one immediate destination's required documents are present, using the running workflow snapshot.
It does not walk beyond that destination or require documents for branches the run has not chosen.
The editor refuses an action from one agent step to another unless every type the destination requires is also required by the source.
The source cannot be decided until its own required types are present, and no one can file a document while an agent holds the step, so the subset rule guarantees the destination is never stuck.
An editor stacking agent steps satisfies it by requiring the later documents on the earlier agent step too, or by inserting a human step between the agents to collect or verify more documents.
The seeded documentation-check agent, which currently chooses an incomplete branch because a document is missing, is replaced by an agent task consistent with required meaning required.

While a case is draft, any visitor in its session may add an allowed document.
After submission, only the current step's assignee may add one; a person may gather a document from someone else and file it themselves.
This is a CaseWork permission check in the API as well as the UI, never a FlowCore interpretation of the assignee reference.
Submitted documents cannot be deleted under the existing history rule, so presence established by a check remains true for the rest of that run.

# State

_What the client must remember._

FlowCore stores the workflow graph and the record of work performed.
Everything below is CaseWork's own, in CaseWork's own tables, because the library holds no subjects.

_Submission_ — what the queue needs, common to both types

- id
- session id // which visitor's copy this is; see Session scoping
- type // claim | application
- reference // "C-1042", "P-2087"
- status // draft | submitted
- created_at, submitted_at
- flowcore_definition_id // the workflow it was submitted under, nullable while a draft
- subject_reference // what FlowCore was given, derived and stored so lookups need no re-derivation
- revision // bumped whenever a document is added or removed or a detail edited; what FlowCore records as the subject version token

_Claim detail_ — everything the claim screens show

- submission_id
- policy_number, claimant_name
- amount
- incident_narrative // the claimant's own account, in their words
- occurred_at

_Application detail_ — the other screens

- submission_id
- proposer_name
- cover_type, sum_insured
- disclosures // free text; what the risk screen reads

_Document_

- id, submission_id
- name, document_type_id // stable CaseWork type identity; display title and sample kind live on the type
- received_at
- body // text, nullable — a photograph is a row with no body
- added_at_revision // the submission revision this document arrived at

_Document type_ — CaseWork's catalog of kinds of case material

- id, session id
- kind // stable identifier used to match sample files
- title // human-facing label; cosmetic edits do not change the type id
- pass finding, fail finding // text used only by the simulated checker

_Allowed document type_ — which kinds may be added to one submission type

- session id, submission type, document type id

The allowed list is independent of workflow steps.
CaseWork refuses to remove a type from the list while a registered workflow definition for the affected submission type or an open instance of that type requires it.
Completed instances retain frozen references and history but do not block removal from a future Add document selector.
Hard deletion of a document type used by a document or workflow instance is refused; retiring it from future selection does not erase its identity.

Documents carry text rather than files.
Agent steps read them, so the text is the point; a binary would add upload, storage and a media story for nothing.

Documents are superseded, never replaced.
A second estimate does not overwrite the first: both rows stay, and the **current** document of a type is the newest one of that type.
The Documents box has Current and Archive tabs; Current shows the newest document of each type, and Archive shows superseded documents ordered by type and version.
Both tabs and each history entry open the same right-hand drawer with the document text, version, received date, currency, and distinct names of the steps whose completed decisions included it as a decision document.
A document with no body explicitly says that it has no text.
Versions are computed as ordinals among the surviving documents of each type, oldest first.
Removal can therefore renumber later documents; document ids and case revision stamps remain the historical references.

This makes a repeated step answerable afterwards.
A run that reaches a step twice has two visits, each stamping the revision it decided against, so the decision documents on each visit resolve to the current document of each frozen required type _as of_ that revision.
The first visit's remark keeps pointing at the estimate it was actually about, which it would not if the upload had overwritten it.

Documents do not reference a visit.
A document is a fact about the case, not about the workflow, and a draft has documents and no run at all — so the reference would have to be nullable, and every reader would need two paths.
The version token and the visit's frozen required input type IDs carry the join.
History calls those matches **decision documents**, not "read": the configuration names what should be considered, but cannot prove which files a person actually opened.

_User_ — the seeded cast, shared and read-only

- reference // "user:dana", opaque to FlowCore
- name, title
- groups // the references they also answer to

_Workflow registry_ — which workflow is active for which type

- id
- session id
- submission_type
- name
- flowcore_definition_id
- active // one per {session, submission_type}

This table is the entire mechanism behind "specify when a workflow applies".
FlowCore takes a definition id and starts a run; it has no notion of a claim type, and will not acquire one.
CaseWork stores what a graph is _for_.

_Session scoping_

Every row above except `user` carries a session id.

Hosting means concurrent visitors, and without isolation two people signing in as Dana would work the same claim.
On first arrival CaseWork copies a template dataset into rows tagged with that visitor's session: the two workflows through `Catalog.Create`, the two drafted submissions, and their documents.

The cast is shared and read-only.
What belongs to a visitor is the work, not the people.

This is the same principle the previous version used — the client owns tenancy because FlowCore has none — expressed in rows rather than in memory.

# Screens

Three navigation items and one action.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **My work** | the shared queue; the landing page after sign-in |
| **Cases** | every submission, searchable — for looking something up |
| **Workflows** | the configurations |
| **+ New submission** | a button |

1. **Sign in** — pick from the seeded cast. Also where the application explains what it is and links to the repository, so that material reaches every visitor without appearing on a single working screen.
2. **My work** — what is waiting on this person. Reference, type, step, how long it has waited.
3. **Case detail, claim** — the claim file, its documents, and a panel showing where it stands and what can be done.
4. **Case detail, application** — the same shape, entirely different content.
5. **New submission** — pick a type, fill the form, save as a draft or submit.
6. **Workflow view** — the graph, large and readable. Read only.
7. **Workflow editor** — changing it.

The queue is shared across both submission types, because "what should I do next" does not sort by type.
The detail screens are not shared, because a claim and an application have nothing in common below the header.

Deliberately absent: a dashboard, user administration, settings, and any explanation of the library inside a working screen.

# Responsibilities

_Who owns which decision._

**React** renders and collects input.
It holds no domain rules.
It does not know what a visit is; it returns the value it was given.

**The Go API** composes what a screen needs, in the application's vocabulary.
One request per screen, returning a claim or an application — not a workflow, a run and a visit for the browser to assemble.
The exception is the workflow editor, whose endpoints mirror `Catalog`, because that screen genuinely is about definitions, steps and actions.

**`internal/app`** is the client half of the boundary and survives the rewrite nearly whole.
It resolves identity into references, stores and reads subjects, selects the workflow for a submission, dispatches agent steps onto its own queue, and turns the library's typed errors into sentences.
It enforces allowed document types, required documents, agent instruction presence, and document permissions against the run snapshot where a run exists.

**FlowCore** stores the workflow graph, routes a run through it, records who decided what and why, and answers what is waiting on a set of references.
It snapshots neutral instructions and opaque required input type IDs on every step and exposes open work and action targets from instances.
It interprets nothing it is given.

```

Nothing in the browser talks to FlowCore.
Nothing in FlowCore talks to a model.

# Invariants

_Rules that must not break._

- **A submission belongs to exactly one session**, and no query returns another session's rows.
  Tenancy is the client's, enforced in CaseWork, because the library has no tenant column.
- **A submitted submission has one active FlowCore run**, and a draft has none.
  Earlier completed runs remain in history after reopening; submitting is the only thing that starts a new run.
- **A run keeps the workflow it started under.**
  Activating a different workflow changes what future submissions use and reaches nothing already running.
  This is FlowCore's guarantee, not the client's, and CaseWork must not undermine it by rewriting `flowcore_definition_id` on an existing submission.
- **The browser never decides routing.**
  Which actions exist, and where each leads, come from the library through the API.
- **An agent step is an ordinary step.**
  Nothing in the schema, the API, or the library marks one as special; only CaseWork's `agent:` prefix convention decides that its worker picks it up.
- **Required means a decision cannot be made without the named document types present.**
  CaseWork checks the current step before completion, checks an immediate agent destination before the chosen action, and checks an agent entry step before starting a run.
  All run-side checks use frozen step configuration; definition edits affect future runs only.
- **Document availability and document requirements are separate.**
  The Add document selector always shows the case type's allowed list, and CaseWork checks that list when filing; an allowed document need not be required by any step.
  Once submitted, only the current step assignee may file a document.
- **An open agent visit is discovered from the run, even if its definition was edited.**
  Dispatcher recovery and assignment choices read current visits and their frozen assignees, with session filtering in CaseWork.
- **A remark is written with the decision it explains**, in one call, so a failure cannot separate them.
- **A document is never overwritten, and can be deleted only while its case is draft and no decision in any previous run had it on file.**
  A newer document of the same type supersedes an older one; both rows survive, and the superseded one stays on the case.
  A decision's remark would otherwise outlive the document it was about — an unused document can be removed only before submission or after reopening to draft.
  Submission and deletion serialize on the case row, so a stale draft request cannot remove a document after a new run starts.
  Deleting bumps the case revision and can make an older document current again.
  That is safe rather than merely permitted.
  A visit resolves its decision documents as the newest of each frozen required type at or below the revision it stamped, so a document appearing in no visit's set is one that, at every earlier revision, either did not exist yet, had already been superseded, or was not among that visit's required types.
  Removing it changes no past answer.
- **Every completion records the revision it was decided against.**
  CaseWork bumps `submission.revision` on any change an agent could read, and passes it as FlowCore's subject version token.
  The library records it and never compares it — noticing that a subject moved on is CaseWork's job, and it is the only thing that makes a second visit to a step distinguishable from the first.
