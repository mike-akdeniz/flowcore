// ErrorMessage turns a FlowCore error into a sentence someone editing a workflow
// can act on.
//
// This function is the reason a library's error taxonomy is worth designing
// carefully, and the reason that design is invisible until something builds a
// real interface on top of it. Every branch below exists because the library
// returns a distinct type rather than one opaque error, and each one produces
// different advice.
//
// Note what is not here: no string matching on error text, and no inspection of
// the underlying database error. The library maps constraint violations to typed
// errors so its callers never have to know what a constraint is, and this is what
// that buys.
