// because deciding who belongs to a group needs an identity model the library
// does not have. And the result is filtered to this session's own definitions,
// because the library has no tenant and the worklist spans every run in the
// database.

// The filter is possible because AssignedStep carries WorkflowDefinitionID, so no
// assignee string has to be namespaced: a visitor who types "group:security" into
// the configuration form gets exactly that stored.
